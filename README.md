# RPiHSM
The project goal was to find out which extent off-the-shelf Internet of Things (IoT) modules (e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi) could be programmed to function as a Hardware Security Module (HSM).  After a comparison between the different IoT modules we have concluded that the most suitable device was the **Raspberry Pi 3 model B**, hence the name **RPiHSM**.
## Installation
To install this application please look at the relative sub projects instructions under `Application`. You can also find (under `Design\Raspberry Pi case (3D models)`) the 3D models of our RPi case.
## Usage
This application can run under Windows, Mac OS and Linux (more information can be found in the sub projects directories). To use this application a **Raspberry Pi 3 model B** is needed. All the instructions about the application and its features can be found under `Documentation`.
